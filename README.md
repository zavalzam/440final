# Running The Server
This repository contains source code for the Movies and Media front end website

The site uses node.js so npm is required. To run the server, first clone or copy the repo into somewhere that you have npm and node.js installed, such as the ENGR server. Open a bash shell, then navigate into the project folder. To run the server, simply run the command PORT=XXXX npm start. You can then navigate to the correct flip server with the port number you used and access the website. For example, http://flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu:4368/ where flip2 is the server we were on and 4368 is the port we selected
